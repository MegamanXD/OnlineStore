This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting started

In the project directory, run:

### 1. `npm install`

This app does not contain the node_modules folder, so you need to install them before you can run it normally.

### 2. `npm start`

Runs the app. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
